This is a gitutorial so you may want to start at the first commit
(SHA: 59816053ce89c243c037acdc42a3b7d309ab5cc4) and work your way up
to HEAD.

This is all just some kind of transcript of my learning efforts so it
*could* contain stupid mistakes, but I test all commits before pushing
so is hope there won't be any fatal errors.

This is a gitutorial so you may want to start at the first commit
(59816053ce89c243c037acdc42a3b7d309ab5cc4) and work your way up to
HEAD.

This is all just some kind of transcript of my learnings so it *can*
contain stupid mistakes, but I test all commits before pushing them so
is hope there won't be any fatal mistakes.
